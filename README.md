# Submission Notes:

I encountered some issues with the API service, so I resorted to using fake data locally. However, the network logic is still implemented, and you can find it there.

My primary focus during the development of the app was on the Compose logic. However, due to time constraints, I had to skip addressing some issues before delivering the current version. That said, I plan to continue working on the project for the next two days to resolve the following issues:
1. Improve the UI arrangement on the Home Screen.
2. Refactor and relocate all reusable components to a new module.
3. Implement a proper multi-module architecture to host the features.
4. Introduce Gradle Conversion plugins to streamline the creation of new feature modules and modules in general.
5. Add a splash screen and a Hotel details screen.
6. Connect the app to an actual API to make it fully functional.

To quickly preview the app, please install the [app-debug.apk](https://github.com/Abed-Murad/android-test-assignment/blob/main/app-debug.apk)
